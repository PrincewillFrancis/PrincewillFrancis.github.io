<p>Around the beginning of "404 page not found", Wagner recalls the nostalgia of the early days on the internet, where users were in a much less commercialized environment, as seen in the quote: "Like many people my age and older, I miss the pre-social media internet." In the early days of the internet, there weren't as many websites filled with ads or government/electoral campaigns everywhere to invade the minds of the average user, which Wagner talks about in her essay. I believe that this early internet was filled with more life and passion than it is now. The average website was far more personal and a lot less corporate or business-linked.</p></section>

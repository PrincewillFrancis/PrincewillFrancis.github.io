<section> <p>Welcome to Crapple, the leader in pushing the boundaries of what it means to be human.
Here at Crapple, we believe that technology is the ultimate key to surpassing the limits of
our current human potential. From robotic arms to our new and revolutionary iEyes, the
products that we offer are designed to enhance and improve every part of your life. </p>
		
<p>About Us: We [The fictitious entity, Crapple,] aim to be the leading company in furthering
  what humans are capable of doing and performing. Crapple was founded by two very
  intelligent thinkers, Jeve Stobs and Weve Stozniak,-two half human, half robotic leaders
  of the transhumanist movement. Our objective is to convince individuals to integrate the
  power and speed of new technology into their bodies, to allow for the destruction of their
  once human limitations. Whether it is as simple as replacing one limb, or even adopting an
  entire robotic body, we believe that it is a step into the right future, one where technology
  makes us into the most productive we can be. You see, here at Crapple, we believe in more
  than just enhancement. We believe in being truly free and living life to the fullest.</p></section>

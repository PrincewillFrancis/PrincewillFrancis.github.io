<h1>George Orwell in his essay Why I Write:</h1>
</header>
<p>"From a very early age, perhaps the age of five or six, I knew that when I grew up I should be a writer. Between the ages of about seventeen and twenty-four I tried to abandon this idea, but I did so with the consciousness that I was outraging my true nature and that sooner or later I should have to settle down and write books. I was the middle child of three, but there was a gap of five years on either side, and I barely saw my father before I was eight. For this and other reasons I was somewhat lonely, and I soon developed disagreeable mannerisms which made me unpopular throughout my schooldays. I had the lonely child's habit of making up stories and holding conversations with imaginary persons, and I think from the very start my literary ambitions were mixed up with the feeling of being isolated and undervalued. I knew that I had a facility with words and a power of facing unpleasant facts, and I felt that this created a sort of private world in which I could get my own back for my failure in everyday life."

	"However, the problem of language and the technique of writing were of little or no importance to me compared with the question of my own motives. What I have most wanted to do throughout the past ten years is to make political writing into an art. My starting point is always a feeling of partisanship, a sense of injustice. When I sit down to write a book, I do not say to myself, "I am going to produce a work of art" I write it because there is some lie that I want to expose, some fact to which I want to draw attention, and my initial concern is to get a hearing. But I could not do the work of writing a book, or even a long magazine article, if it were not also an aesthetic experience. Anyone who cares to examine my work will see that even when it is downright propaganda it contains much that a full-time politician would consider irrelevant. I am not able, and do not want, completely to abandon the world-view that I acquired in childhood."

<h1>My thoughts on this excerpt</h1>
</header>
<p>"I believe that writing should be more artistic and free from the motivations of things like politics. Writing should consider the aspects of your own aesthetic and self-expression, unlike Orwell's excerpt. In my view, the purpose of writing lies not in conveying political arguments or addressing societal issues, but in capturing personal experiences, emotions, and imagination. Like how a painter focuses on form, color, and composition to express themselves, a writer should prioritize the beauty of language, rhythm, and narrative over any ideological views.

	Prioritizing artistic expression over politics in writing offers a more intimate connection between the writer and the audience. It allows for the creation of works that transcend politics, resonating with readers on a personal level. When writers are free to explore their own ideas, and are not bound by external agendas, the result is literature that is authentic and timeless, true art. Literature becomes an note of human nature, dreams, and creativity, rather than a response to fleeting political events. This freedom makes writing not just a tool for communication, but a way to fulfill an artist's personal exploration."

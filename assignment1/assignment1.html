<p class="intro">In Kate Wagner essay, "404 page not found", she talks about her many reasons for her preference of the old internet as compared to the new internet. Within the writing, Wagner' essay is filled with lots of nostalgia for the old internet, the rise of Web 2.0 and the cultural impacts of the new internet, as seen in places such as schools. In my essay, I will expand on and respond to each of these points and give my own feedback on each topic. </p>

<p class="body1">Around the beginning of "404 page not found", Wagner recalls the nostalgia of the early days on the internet, where users were in a much less commercialized environment, as seen in the quote: "Like many people my age and older, I miss the pre-social media internet." In the early days of the internet, there weren't as many websites filled with ads or government/electoral campaigns everywhere to invade the minds of the average user, which Wagner talks about in her essay. I believe that this early internet was filled with more life and passion than it is now. The average website was far more personal and a lot less corporate or business-linked. </p>

<p class="body2">In her essay, Wagner also talks about the rise of Web 2.0, the second stage of development of the World Wide Web, characterized especially by the change from static web pages to dynamic or user-generated content and the growth of social media. (Definition from Oxford Languages.) "Web 2.0...where users became active consumers, creators, and participants of a service in which they had very little, if any, agency." Wagner sees Web 2.0 as a new and unimproved version of the internet, one that is missing the creativeness and new ideas that Web 1.0 had. I agree with this statement. Even though there are a lot more websites now than before, the websites produced by the newer age of the internet unfortunately are on average not as creative as older web pages, even with the accessibility of better plugins and sources to make sites look cleaner. Newer websites are often copies of other ones, or are sites that lead to commercials or ads, or spaces that are not creative, but are used to lure people. </p>

<p class="body3">The new age of the internet has had many impacts on culture and race. "One white teen, for instance, called Myspace a "ghetto,". Wagner uses this line to provide more details on the destructiveness of the new internet. Facebook was a site only for Harvard students in its beginnings, and this causes those students who were able to use Facebook to see those who could not as "underneath" themselves, causing divides between people on the internet. "...and another described Facebook as "the place where the 'honors kids' got together and discussed how they were procrastinating over their next AP English essay." The description of Facebook as a place for "honors kids" shows that it was seen as a place for the "elites." This suggests that Facebook was seen as a platform where a class of intelligent, more privileged students gathered, distinguishing it from Myspace. Wagner sees these types of unfriendly rivalries between students as a product of the newer internet, as cases like these did not exist or were very faint in the old internet. </p>

<p class="conclusion">All in all, I agree with most of the points that Wagner brings up in this essay, and the idea that the older internet was more life-like and less messy than the more modern internet is something I can back up. The old and the new internet have had vastly different impacts on the average user. During the days of Web 1.0, the average website was a lot more human and creative than the websites of today. Many of today's sites are made without that human touch, created with the sole purpose of luring people to its ideas and to force ads or campaigns or other sources down your throat.</p>

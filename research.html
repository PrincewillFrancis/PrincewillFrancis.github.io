                <h3>Extreme Tech: "What is transhumanism, or, what does it mean to be human?"</h3>
		
                <p>"Transhumanism is a cultural and intellectual movement that believes we can, and should, improve the human condition through the use of advanced technologies. One of the core concepts in transhumanist thinking is life extension: Through genetic engineering, nanotech, cloning, and other emerging technologies, eternal life may soon be possible."?
		
The quote from Extreme Tech supports the premise of my final project as it explains how eternal life may be possible through the use of technologies such as genetic engineering and nanotech, which would be applied to our human bodies to improve upon our body's design (https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/152240-what-is-transhumanism-or-what-does-it-mean-to-be-human)</p>

                <h3>The Guardian: "No death and an enhanced life: Is the future transhuman?"</h3>
		
                <p>"The idea of technologically enhancing our bodies is not new. But the extent to which transhumanists take the concept is. In the past, we made devices such as wooden legs, hearing aids, spectacles and false teeth. In future, we might use implants to augment our senses so we can detect infrared or ultraviolet radiation directly or boost our cognitive processes by connecting ourselves to memory chips. Ultimately, by merging man and machine, science will produce humans who have vastly increased intelligence, strength, and lifespans; a near embodiment of gods."

This quote from The Guardian supports the premise of my final project as they believe that the combination of man and machine will propel humans far. The Guardian even believes that transhumanism will make humans "a near embodiment of gods.", which shows that they're very supportive of this idea. (https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/06/no-death-and-an-enhanced-life-is-the-future-transhuman)</p>

                <h3>Revista Idees/Miguel Casas: "The technological singularity and the transhumanist dream"</h3>
                
		
                <p>"Many of those who call themselves transhumanists have been arguing for decades that the technological singularity could solve humanity's greatest ills: cure all disease, produce clean energy that helps to win the fight against climate change, reduce the cost of producing and distributing food to end hunger and develop technologies to colonise space so as to overcome overpopulation of the planet. At the same time, it might also make achievable the ancient dream of immortality, by digitising our brains and putting them in the cloud."?
Revista Idees supports Crapple's ideas by providing ways that technology is used inside the body and how they could improve upon the lives of billions. Curing diseases, producing clean energy, and reducing the cost of food. (https://revistaidees.cat/en/the-technological-singularity-and-the-transhumanist-dream/)</p>

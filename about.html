	<h2>About Us</h2><p>Here at Crapple, we aim to be the leading company in furthering what humans are capable of doing and performing. Crapple was founded by two very intelligent thinkers, Jeve Stobs and Weve Stozniak,-two half human, half robotic leaders of the transhumanist movement. Our objective is to convince individuals to integrate the power and speed of new technology into their bodies, to allow for the destruction of their once human limitations. Whether it's as simple as replacing one limb, or even adopting an entire robotic body, we believe that it is a step into the right future, one where technology makes us into the most productive we can be. You see, here at Crapple, we believe in more than just enhancement. We believe in being truly free and living life to the fullest.</p>
